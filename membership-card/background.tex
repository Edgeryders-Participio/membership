    \section*{Consent is F.R.I.E.S.}
    \vspace{-3mm}
    The Borderland is an inclusive place for everyone to express themselves and experiment. Such a place relies on our ability to respect each other's boundaries.
    \\[-0.7\baselineskip]

    State both your wishes and your boundaries out loud, and think of deep-fried potatoes:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{F}reely Given --- Consent is given without pressure, force, or manipulation.
    \item \textbf{R}eversible --- Change your mind about anything at any time.
    \item \textbf{I}nformed --- Be honest about your intentions.
    \item \textbf{E}nthusiastic --- Sometimes people say ``yes'' just to be polite.
    \item \textbf{S}pecific --- Saying yes to one thing doesn’t mean they've said yes to others.
    \end{itemize}

    \vspace{3mm}
%\fontsize{11pt}{11pt}\selectfont
    Consent applies anywhere, including: \textbf{touch} (including hugs!), \textbf{kink} (a yes to spanking doesn't mean you can grope), \textbf{gifts} (keep your \textsc{moop}), \textbf{foods} (people have very different restrictions), \textbf{photography} (some of us have security clearances).
    \vspace{-4mm}
    \section*{Get Informed}
    \vspace{-3mm}
    How do I express my desires without being awkward? What's the difference between serving and accepting, taking and allowing? How can I help take care of people and ensure an inclusive Borderland?

    Inclusion is everyone's responsibility. If you see something that looks non-consensual or someone who looks like they're in distress, it's your job to check in!
